# STORY
Currently, there are only 24 African countries exporting food items to Europe. Nigeria has the second largest share of all the products exported, after Sudan. Between the year 2007 and 2019 goods from the most populous black nation have been rejected 82 times at the European border. Of all the times made in Nigeria goods were rejected, 99% of the goods were nuts, nut products and seeds.

# Advice to HiCi Foods
1. First, I suggest that HiCi Ltd should decrease supply of nuts, nut products and seeds to Europe. This will allow the company to focus more of its resources on the more profitable products.
2. The company should increase export of herbs and spices, gastropods, fruits and vegitables, as these are the most accepted products from Nigeria. 
3. Seeing that Nigeria is one of only two African countries exporting fruits and vegetables to Europe, HiCi can choose to focus their resources to increase production and storage for these highly perishable goods, so that more of them can reach their destination country in good condition.
